# RecCenterProject
Project Problem Statement: 
Students who would like to view the different events at the Campus Rec Center have to go through Instagram or their website to find the information. I believe that making all the information in a centralized location while adding features showing the number of people at the gym, daily workouts, and a calendar showing various events would benefit students.
